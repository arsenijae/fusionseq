FusionSeq includes filters to remove spurious candidate fusions with artifacts such as misalignments or random pairing of transcript fragments and it ranks candidates according to several statistics. It also has a module to identify exact sequences at breakpoint junctions. FusionSeq detected known and novel fusions in a specially sequenced calibration data set, including 8 cancers with and without known rearrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [FusionSeq Web site](https://pbtech.med.cornell.edu/faculty/sboner/lab/secure/FusionSeq/)\r\nThis is the main FusionSeq web-site with the results of the analyses (only authorized people can access)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### [Documentation for the user](Documentation for the user)\r\nThis section provides the documentation for the user, including instructions to download and install the source code.\r\n\r\n#### [Documentation for the developer](Documentation for the developer)\r\nThis section provides more specific documentation for the developer.\r\n\r\n#### [Download](Download)\r\nThe source code is available via [GitHub](https://github.com/sbonerlab/fusionseq/).
